# Fab AI Writing Style Guide 

This style guide captures the established writing conventions of Fab AI. 

---

## 1. Voice and Tone

**Rule**: Maintain an authoritative but accessible tone, using first-person institutional voice ("we") for initiative communications while reserving formal passive constructions for policy-facing documents.

**Updated evidence**: Recent initiative documents demonstrate a shift toward active, first-person voice. Phrases like "We support", "Our initiative", and "We aim to" appear throughout, creating a more engaging and direct style than traditional development sector writing.

**Examples**:
- "We are in the early stages of a new cycle of upgrading how we work, driven by AI."
- "Our initiative is the global authority on AI in education for LMICs."
- "We support R&D and piloting of AI-EdTech solutions that are evidence-based, technically sound and affordable."
- "We have built an open-source platform and community to provide knowledge, guidance and training."

**Guidelines**:
- Use "we" and "our" for initiative-led communications (proposals, one-pagers, updates)
- Reserve passive voice (approximately 20–30%) for policy documents, evaluations, and formal reports to external bodies
- Balance confidence with measured language: be authoritative about capabilities while acknowledging challenges
- Employ hedging appropriately ("may", "approximately", "likely") for claims requiring professional caution
- Maintain an open, collaborative spirit — the phrase "learning out loud" captures the willingness to discuss challenges alongside successes

---

## 2. Sentence Structure and Length

**Rule**: Use varied sentence lengths, favouring complex constructions averaging 22–28 words, with shorter sentences for emphasis or key points.

**Updated evidence**: Recent documents demonstrate slightly shorter average sentences than the corpus-wide 27.7 words, with greater variation for rhetorical effect. Complex sentences with embedded clauses remain common, but punchy statements are used strategically.

**Examples**:
- Short for impact: "This takes time." (3 words)
- Medium for clarity: "We want to be the place where people get news and guidance as we are the authority in this space." (20 words)
- Long for complexity: "Given the reliance of many tools on the foundational models built by 'big tech', and the evidence on the impact of high-quality inputs on these models, moving towards open, transparent education training data built out of high-quality materials for LMICs is necessary." (44 words)

**Guidelines**:
- Target 20–30 words per sentence for main content
- Use shorter sentences (8–15 words) to emphasise key conclusions or transitions
- Employ em-dashes liberally to insert parenthetical information without fragmenting sentences
- Vary sentence length within paragraphs to maintain reader engagement
- Ensure readability remains accessible (approximately grade 6.5–8 level)

## 3. Vocabulary and Terminology

**Rule**: Use sector-specific terminology consistently, incorporating both established development language and emerging AI/EdTech vocabulary.

**Updated evidence**: Recent documents introduce AI-specific terminology alongside traditional education development vocabulary. Key additions include: "ecosystem" (ecosystem-building), "backbone", "benchmarks" (AI-specific), "learning by doing", "thought leadership", "knowledge products", "quality assurance frameworks", and "digital public goods".

**Core terminology by category**:

| Category | Terms |
|----------|-------|
| Education development | education sector, learning outcomes, foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN), quality education, capacity building, development partners, education workforce |
| AI/Technology | AI-EdTech, large language models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), benchmarks, training data, open-source, hallucinations |
| Initiative-specific | ecosystem, backbone, learning by doing, thought leadership, knowledge products, quality assurance, public goods, digital public good |
| Partnership | north-south partnerships, south-south collaboration, knowledge diffusion, white label |
| Economics | unit economics, smart buys, market failures, advanced market commitments |

**Examples**:
- "We support R&D and piloting of AI-EdTech solutions that are evidence-based, technically sound and affordable."
- "The initiative is centred around five interlinked components, which help us both build the backbone for equitable AI use."
- "Benchmarks have emerged as a key technique for assessing quality and publicly sharing them."

**Guidelines**:
- Introduce abbreviations on first use with full term: "low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)", "foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN)"
- Use "AI-EdTech" (hyphenated) when referring to AI-powered educational technology products
- Prefer "ecosystem" (one word) for consistency, though "eco-system" appears in some documents
- Use "focussed" (British variant) alongside standard British spellings
- Maintain British spelling conventions: "programme", "realise", "colour", "organisation", "centre"

## 4. Document Structure Conventions

**Rule**: Follow hierarchical templates with context-first organisation, using component-based structures for proposals and outcome tables for measurable deliverables.

**Updated patterns**: Recent documents demonstrate a component-based structure for complex proposals (Component One, Component Two, etc.) and use of timeline markers for deliverables.

**Standard structures**:

*Technical proposals*:
- Introduction/Executive summary
- Context/Background (the emerging landscape)
- The need for investment
- Building on our successes (reflection on previous phases)
- Our proposal (component-based breakdown)
- Theory of change diagram
- Outcomes table

*One-pagers/Initiative introductions*:
- Opening statement (who we are, what we do)
- How we work (methods and approach)
- Key workstreams (using bold for emphasis)
- Funders/Partners

*Component structure example*:
- Component One: Thought leadership and knowledge products
- Component Two: Community engagement and partnerships
- Component Three: Training, capacity building and advisory
- Component Four: Quality assurance
- Component Five: Learning by doing

**Guidelines**:
- Begin with contextual background that situates the work
- Use numbered components for multi-part proposals
- Include theory of change diagrams for strategic documents
- Use tables for outcomes with numbered rows and measurement columns
- Mark timeline deliverables in italics with parentheses: *(by September 2025)*
- Include a reflection section for phase-based funding ("what worked, what needs updating")

## 5. Formatting Conventions

**Rule**: Use strategic formatting — including bold emphasis, bullet points, em-dashes, and tables — to highlight key information while maintaining narrative flow.

**Updated evidence**: Recent documents make extensive use of bold text for emphasis, em-dashes for parenthetical information, and bullet points for deliverables. This represents a shift from the corpus-wide "minimal formatting" pattern.

**Bold usage**:
- Key terms and concepts: "**shaping the vision for our ecosystem**"
- Workstream names: "**Quality Assurance**"
- Important outcomes: "**aligned view of investments**"
- Action-oriented phrases: "**working in partnership with others**"

**Em-dash usage**:
- Parenthetical clarification: "LMIC's are not left behind as the new technologies emerge — and applications built."
- Emphasis: "This requires funding — and time."
- Lists within sentences: "support through small grants — 'learning by doing' investments in high-impact organisations"

**Bullet points**:
- Use for deliverables, outcomes, and action items
- Include timeline markers where appropriate
- Keep bullets substantive (1–3 sentences)
- Use sparingly — prefer narrative prose for explanations

**Examples**:
- "We will agree a strategy for what kind of training is needed *(by January 2025)*"
- "This will include: **ecosystem mapping**, **ecosystem strategy**, and **evolution of the economics of the market**"

**Guidelines**:
- Use bold for 3–6 key terms per section; avoid over-bolding
- Use em-dashes (—) or double hyphens (--) for parenthetical insertions
- Reserve bullet points for deliverables, not explanatory content
- Use italics with parentheses for timeline markers: *(ongoing)*, *(by Dec 2025)*
- Include hyperlinks to relevant resources and platforms
- Use tables for outcomes with clear columns for targets and measurement criteria

---

## 6. How Findings Are Presented

**Rule**: Present findings through narrative integration with embedded statistics, using specific metrics to support claims.

**Examples**:
- "A recent mapping by the AI-for-Education.org initiative found 79 AI-edtech products focusing on LMICs."
- "A recent study by Rising Academies of their Chatbot Rori found a 0.39 SD increase in learning outcomes."
- "We have built out the AI-for-Education.org platform, which gets 3,000 unique visitors each month, and now have 23,000 followers on LinkedIn."
- "The newer models being **240x cheaper** than the original GPT 3.5."

**Guidelines**:
- Embed quantitative evidence naturally into narrative flow
- Use specific numbers and percentages rather than vague qualifiers
- Reference specific organisations and studies by name
- Bold particularly striking statistics for emphasis
- Use dashes for statistical clarification: "2.2 million school-aged children are out of school — 75% of the country's children"

## 7. How Recommendations Are Framed

**Rule**: Use direct language with clear agency attribution, timeline markers, and measured confidence levels.

**Examples**:
- "We will aim to **define a vision** for the eco-system and develop knowledge products."
- "We will develop a white paper on how AI could improve learning at scale *(by September 2025)*."
- "Here, we want to involve other funders to help test pathways for long-term funding."
- "For phase two, we will look to again avoid duplication of effort."

**Guidelines**:
- Use "we will" for commitments
- Use "we aim to" or "we look to" for aspirational goals
- Use "should" for recommendations to external parties
- Include timeline markers for concrete deliverables
- Assign clear agency (who will do what, by when)
- Balance ambition with acknowledgement of constraints

---

## 8. Use of Evidence and Data References

**Rule**: Present data through institutional attribution and specific metrics integrated into narrative flow, with hyperlinks to sources where available.

**Examples**:
- "UNICEF estimates that 2.2 million school-aged children are out of school"
- "We have a [**live products dashboard**](https://ai-for-education.org/ai-products/), which tracks global AI-EdTech developments"
- "A recent study by Rising Academies of their Chatbot Rori found a 0.39 SD increase in learning outcomes, while an RCT of EIDU's work in Kenya also showed significant learning impacts (0.43SD)"

**Guidelines**:
- Cite institutions and organisations directly without formal academic citation style
- Use hyperlinks for references to online resources, dashboards, and platforms
- Include effect sizes (standard deviations) for impact evidence
- Reference specific monetary values, percentages, and counts
- Use bold for particularly striking figures

---

## 9. Common Phrases and Formulations

**Rule**: Use consistent professional formulations and the initiative's distinctive language patterns.

**Updated phrase inventory**:

| Category | Phrases |
|----------|---------|
| Scale and impact | learning at scale, impact at scale, improve learning at scale |
| Approach | learning by doing, learning out loud, bottom-up approach, built from the bottom up |
| Partnerships | working in partnership with others, north-south partnerships, south-south collaboration, knowledge diffusion |
| Ecosystem | shape the ecosystem, ecosystem strategy, backbone, digital public good |
| Quality | quality assurance, evidence-based, evidence frameworks, benchmarks, smart buys |
| Capacity | capacity building, AI literacy, training and capacity building |
| Products | thought leadership, knowledge products, open-source code |
| Process | building on, in conjunction with, lessons learnt, ongoing |

**Transitional language**:
- "Building on our commitment to..."
- "Alongside this..."
- "Here, we will look to..."
- "This means..."
- "In parallel..."
- "However..."

**Guidelines**:
- Use "lessons learnt" (not "lessons learned")
- Use "in conjunction with" for partnerships
- Use "building on" to show sequential logic
- Use "alongside this" for parallel activities
- Use "this means" to translate strategy into practical implications

---

## 10. Reflective and Learning-Oriented Language

**Rule**: Incorporate honest reflection on challenges and lessons learnt, maintaining a "learning out loud" ethos.

**Evidence**: Recent documents include explicit reflection sections discussing what worked and what needs updating, demonstrating openness about challenges.

**Examples**:
- "Looking at what worked, and what needs updating"
- "The first year of the initiative focussed on building engagement — so we spoke to a lot of organisations — this will pay dividends in the long run"
- "A key lesson here is that while 'benchmarks' has a certain meaning for AI products, it also has a broader, common usage"
- "Creating the benchmarks needed is even more complex than we anticipated"

**Guidelines**:
- Include reflection sections in phase-based proposals
- Acknowledge challenges openly while framing them constructively
- Use phrases like "key learnings include", "a key lesson here is", "what needs updating"
- Balance honesty about difficulties with confidence in approach
- Frame lessons learnt as inputs for improved future design
