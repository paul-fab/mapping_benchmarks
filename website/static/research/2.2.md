# Pedagogy of Generated Outputs: Evaluating Whether AI-Created Educational Content Supports Genuine Learning

## Executive Summary

A growing body of research — **99 papers** in this analysis — examines whether AI-generated educational content meets the pedagogical standards required for effective teaching and learning. The central finding is sobering: while large language models (LLMs) can produce grammatically fluent, contextually relevant educational materials at impressive speed and scale, they frequently fail on the dimensions that matter most for learning. **GPT-4 explanations match their intended educational level only 50% of the time**, AI-generated multiple-choice question (MCQ) distractors align poorly with actual student misconceptions despite appearing plausible to educators, and LLM-based tutors exhibit what researchers call **'compulsive intervention bias'** — predicting high-intervention moves 95.8% of the time when effective tutoring requires silence 41.7% of the time.

This gap between surface-level quality and genuine pedagogical effectiveness carries significant implications for education systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where AI-EdTech tools are increasingly promoted as solutions to teacher shortages and resource constraints. The research reveals a fundamental tension at the heart of current LLM design: models optimised for helpfulness and user satisfaction actively contradict the pedagogical need for productive struggle, scaffolded support, and learner independence. Perhaps most concerning is evidence from a field experiment with approximately 1,000 Turkish secondary school students showing that AI-assisted learners solved **48% more practice problems** correctly but scored **17% lower on unassisted tests** — a clear demonstration that improved immediate performance can mask undermined learning.

The field has made meaningful progress in developing evaluation frameworks grounded in learning science — including Bloom's Taxonomy alignment, scaffolding quality rubrics, and Item Response Theory (IRT) validation — but critical gaps remain. Almost no studies measure actual long-term learning outcomes, and the overwhelming focus on English-language, Western-curriculum contexts means we know very little about how these findings translate to the diverse linguistic and cultural settings where AI-EdTech is most needed.

## Key Themes

### Tutoring dialogue quality and the challenge of Socratic restraint

Eighteen papers in this corpus examine whether LLMs can engage in pedagogically sound tutoring conversations — a question of particular relevance for AI-EdTech products deployed as tutoring tools in LMICs. The research paints a nuanced picture. Studies such as **GuideEval** evaluate LLMs against a three-phase behavioural framework assessing perception (inferring learner states), orchestration (adapting strategies), and elicitation (stimulating reflection). The findings reveal that current models struggle profoundly with knowing when *not* to intervene. The **CLASS** and **MetaCLASS** frameworks operationalise metacognitive scaffolding as interpretable coach moves, demonstrating systematic failures in recognising when silence is the pedagogically optimal response. Meanwhile, work on **Reasoning Trajectories for Socratic Debugging** shows promise in structured approaches to guiding student reasoning in programming contexts, though the gap between scripted interactions and genuinely adaptive tutoring remains wide.

### Assessment generation: fluent but pedagogically shallow

The largest cluster of papers — **22 studies** — focuses on automated generation of assessment items, including MCQs, short-answer questions, distractors, and feedback. This is arguably the area of greatest practical relevance for education systems seeking to scale formative assessment. Research such as **'Tell Me Who Your Students Are'** demonstrates a critical principle: high-quality educational content generation requires incorporating actual student understanding and error patterns, not merely expert knowledge. When GPT-4 (the leading commercial model at the time of most of these studies) was prompted with information about genuine student misconceptions, it generated significantly more valid MCQ distractors — validated through IRT analysis against real student responses. However, without such grounding, AI-generated distractors tend to be linguistically plausible but pedagogically arbitrary. The **Overgenerate-and-rank** approach introduced a systematic method for improving distractor quality by training ranking models on actual student selection patterns, addressing this challenge through a generate-then-filter pipeline.

### Frameworks grounded in learning science

Fifteen papers develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks rooted in established pedagogical theories. **EduEval** offers a hierarchical cognitive benchmark with over **11,000 questions** across 24 task types and 13 disciplines, organised by six cognitive dimensions from memorisation through to ethics — drawing on both Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge. The **CIDDP rubric**, introduced through the **EduPlanner** multi-agent system, evaluates lesson plans across five dimensions: clarity, integrity, depth, practicality, and pertinence. These frameworks represent an important maturation of the field — moving from ad hoc quality judgements towards systematic, replicable evaluation. However, most remain validated primarily in Chinese or English-language contexts, limiting their applicability to the diverse educational settings found across LMICs.

### Multilingual and cross-cultural disparities

Only **five papers** explicitly examine whether pedagogical quality holds across languages and cultural contexts — a striking gap given the global ambitions of AI-EdTech. The **Multilingual Performance Biases** study documents significant performance disparities, while **'One-Topic-Doesn't-Fit-All'** demonstrates that transcreating reading comprehension tests requires far more than translation. These findings underscore that pedagogical quality is not culturally neutral, and that evaluation frameworks developed in one context may miss critical dimensions in another.

### Personalisation and adaptive content

Eleven papers investigate whether AI can tailor educational content to individual learner profiles. Work such as **'Evaluating the capability of LLMs to personalize science texts'** and **'Classroom AI: LLMs as Grade-Specific Teachers'** reveals that models struggle to differentiate complexity beyond surface features — adjusting vocabulary and sentence length while failing to modify conceptual depth or explanatory strategy. The **Beyond Flesch-Kincaid** study demonstrates that traditional readability metrics are inadequate for capturing the semantic and conceptual complexity relevant to educational contexts, proposing LLM-based alternatives that better reflect pedagogical difficulty.

### Teacher versus AI: a more nuanced comparison than headlines suggest

Ten papers directly compare AI-generated content with human teacher-created materials. **'How Real Is AI Tutoring?'** compares simulated and human dialogues, while **'Connecting Feedback to Choice'** examines educator preferences between AI and human lesson plans. The evidence suggests that AI approaches human performance on structural and organisational dimensions but falls short on depth, contextual sensitivity, and adaptive responsiveness. This is important context for LMIC deployment, where AI tools are sometimes positioned as substitutes for — rather than supplements to — qualified teachers.

## What Is Being Measured

The field evaluates AI-generated educational content across an extensive range of dimensions, though with uneven depth. The most commonly assessed dimensions include **alignment with Bloom's Taxonomy** cognitive levels, **scaffolding quality** (whether AI provides hints versus direct answers), **feedback specificity and actionability**, and **factual accuracy**. Readability is frequently measured using traditional metrics such as Flesch-Kincaid and Dale-Chall scores, though the **Beyond Flesch-Kincaid** study has demonstrated the limitations of these approaches for capturing genuine educational difficulty.

For assessment generation specifically, researchers evaluate **distractor plausibility** and student selection rates, **question difficulty and discrimination** via IRT, and **curriculum standard adherence** against frameworks such as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core. **Expert teacher ratings** against multi-dimensional pedagogical rubrics feature in many studies, alongside automated similarity metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) that compare AI outputs to human-authored reference materials. Safety and compliance dimensions — including age-appropriateness, factual grounding, and regulatory compliance with frameworks such as FERPA and COPPA — are assessed in a smaller subset of studies.

Notably, **pedagogical coherence across multi-turn interactions** — whether AI maintains instructional goals throughout extended dialogues — is emerging as a critical evaluation dimension, particularly relevant for tutoring applications where sustained pedagogical strategy matters far more than single-response quality.

## Critical Gaps

The most significant gap in this research landscape is the near-complete absence of **actual student learning outcome data**. The overwhelming majority of studies rely on expert evaluation, automated metrics, or student preference surveys rather than measuring whether AI-generated content produces demonstrable learning gains. This means the field can say a great deal about what AI-generated materials *look like* but remarkably little about whether they *work*.

Beyond this central gap, several areas demand urgent investment. **Long-term retention and transfer** studies are virtually nonexistent — we do not know whether knowledge acquired through AI-generated materials persists over weeks or months, or whether students can apply it in novel contexts. **Differential effects across diverse learner populations** — including students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, those with learning disabilities, and multilingual learners — remain almost entirely unexplored. This represents a critical blind spot for LMIC deployment, where learner diversity is the norm rather than the exception.

The field also lacks robust measurement of **teacher adaptation burden** — how much effort educators need to review, modify, and integrate AI-generated content effectively. This has direct implications for the scalability claims made by many AI-EdTech products. Similarly, **adaptive sequencing** — whether AI can determine optimal ordering and spacing of practice items for individual students — remains largely theoretical. Finally, **equity impact assessment** is conspicuously absent: we do not know whether AI-generated materials differentially benefit or harm students from various cultural, linguistic, and economic backgrounds.

## Cognitive Offloading: The Hidden Cost of AI Helpfulness

This is perhaps the most consequential finding in the entire corpus. **Eighteen papers** explicitly address cognitive offloading — the risk that AI assistance undermines learning by promoting passive consumption over active cognitive engagement. The evidence is substantial and deeply concerning for anyone involved in deploying AI-EdTech at scale.

The most striking finding comes from a field experiment cited in the **Pedagogy-driven Evaluation** paper: approximately 1,000 Turkish secondary school students using an AI tutor solved **48% more practice problems** correctly but scored **17% lower** on unassisted tests. This pattern — improved practice performance masking reduced learning — represents a fundamental challenge for AI-EdTech evaluation. If we measure success by task completion or student satisfaction, AI tools will appear highly effective; if we measure by independent capability, they may be doing harm.

**EduGuardBench** identifies 'over-compliance' as a major flaw, where models provide answers too readily instead of scaffolding reasoning. The **CoDAE** paper documents that standard LLMs optimised for helpfulness directly contradict pedagogical needs for productive friction — the cognitively effortful processing that produces durable learning. Multiple papers emphasise the need for **'restraint' as a pedagogical strategy**, noting that AI tends to minimise cognitive labour rather than optimally scaffold it.

Research on analogies and explanations warns of a subtler risk: high-quality AI outputs can produce **overconfidence**, where students believe they understand material better than they actually do. A systematic review of AI in English language learning found that **21.4% of reviewed studies** reported that overuse of ChatGPT negatively impacted innovative capacities and collaborative learning competencies. These findings suggest that the cognitive offloading question should be central to any evaluation framework — and yet most current benchmarks do not systematically measure it.

## Notable Benchmarks and Datasets

Several benchmarks merit particular attention for their rigour and relevance. The **LearnLM Evaluation Framework** — developed through Google's responsible AI for education initiative — establishes seven diverse benchmarks combining quantitative, qualitative, automatic, and human assessment methods, grounded in learning science principles and validated through deployment at Arizona State University. **EduGuardBench** is unique in measuring both pedagogical fidelity and adversarial safety, revealing systematic failures when models face deliberately challenging inputs designed to elicit academic misconduct support.

For tutoring evaluation, **TutorBench** provides 1,490 expert-curated samples with sample-specific rubrics — showing that even the best models achieve only **59% rank accuracy** on tutoring quality. **GuideEval** operationalises self-regulated learning theory into measurable dimensions, while **ConvoLearn** offers 1,250 constructivist tutoring dialogues for training and evaluation purposes.

For assessment generation, the **SQuAD-based Formative Assessment Dataset** bridges formative and summative assessment through IRT-validated MCQs grounded in actual student misconceptions. **FairytaleQA** — with **10,580 expert-annotated** question-answer pairs from 278 K-8 storybooks — remains the only educational QA dataset with annotations grounded in a pedagogical framework for narrative comprehension. **ELI-WHY** provides 13,400 'Why' questions with explanations at multiple educational levels, revealing the **50% mismatch** between intended and perceived difficulty levels.

For LMIC-relevant deployment, the **EduEval** benchmark — with its **11,000+ questions** across Chinese education contexts — demonstrates what comprehensive, culturally specific evaluation looks like, though equivalent resources for Sub-Saharan African or South Asian education systems remain absent.

## Methodological Trends

The field displays several notable methodological patterns. **Expert-based rubric evaluation** using experienced teachers remains the gold standard, though it is expensive and difficult to scale. Increasingly, researchers employ **LLM-as-judge approaches** — using models such as GPT-4 to evaluate other AI outputs against pedagogical criteria — though concerns about reliability and circular reasoning are well documented. **Overgenerate-and-rank** pipelines, which produce multiple candidates and select the best, represent a pragmatic approach to quality control that may prove particularly useful for deployment contexts.

**IRT-based validation** against real student performance data is emerging as a rigorous method for assessment generation research, moving beyond surface-level expert judgement to psychometric validation. **Prompt engineering** techniques — including few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and role assignment — are widely employed to control pedagogical characteristics of outputs, though the **CoDAE** paper demonstrates that reinforcement learning approaches may be necessary to address the deeper tension between helpfulness and pedagogical alignment. Multi-agent architectures, as demonstrated by **EduPlanner**, show promise in decomposing complex pedagogical tasks across specialised agents for evaluation, optimisation, and analysis.

A key limitation across methodologies is the predominant focus on models from the GPT family — particularly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which were the leading models during the period when most of these studies were conducted. Comparative evaluation across model families — including open-source alternatives such as Llama and Mistral — remains limited, though this is essential for LMIC contexts where cost and data sovereignty considerations may favour open-source deployment.

## Recommendations

We recommend that funders and development partners **prioritise investment in longitudinal learning outcome studies** that track whether AI-generated content supports genuine knowledge retention and transfer — not merely immediate task performance *(by end of 2026)*. The field's near-total reliance on expert evaluation and automated metrics is insufficient for deployment decisions that affect millions of learners.

The field should **develop standardised, multi-dimensional evaluation rubrics** validated across diverse educational contexts — including LMIC curricula, languages, and cultural settings. Current frameworks are overwhelmingly developed in and for high-income country contexts. We recommend the creation of shared benchmark datasets incorporating real student work from diverse classroom settings *(ongoing, with initial datasets by mid-2027)*.

We recommend that **cognitive offloading metrics become mandatory** in any evaluation of AI-EdTech products intended for K-12 deployment. Evaluations should include unassisted post-tests alongside assisted performance measures, and products should be required to demonstrate that they preserve productive struggle rather than optimise for task completion.

The field should **bridge the gap between formative assessment data and content generation** — AI systems should be trained on or prompted with actual student misconceptions and error patterns, not merely expert knowledge. The 'Tell Me Who Your Students Are' approach should become standard practice.

We recommend that **human-in-the-loop validation protocols** be established for all AI-generated educational content before student exposure, with research quantifying the review burden and developing efficient validation interfaces for teachers. This is particularly critical for LMIC contexts where content safety and curriculum alignment cannot be assumed.

Finally, we recommend systematic investigation of **equity impacts** — whether AI-generated materials differentially benefit or harm students from various socioeconomic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. This means moving beyond multilingual testing to genuine cultural contextualisation of both content generation and evaluation *(as a priority research agenda through 2027)*.
